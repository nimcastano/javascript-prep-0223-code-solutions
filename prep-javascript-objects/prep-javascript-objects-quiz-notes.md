## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What data types can object properties hold?
An object is made up of properties called name-value pairs. The name is always a string but the value can be of any data type (e.g., string, number, boolean).
- Describe the syntax (structure) of object-literals in JavaScript.
Object literals start with a declaration and a name for the object followed by the assignment operator. The properties of the object must be inside a pair of brackets. The name is separated from its value with a colon and each name-value pair is separated by a comma.
