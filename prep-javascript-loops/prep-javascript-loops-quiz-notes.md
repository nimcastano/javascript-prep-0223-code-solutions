- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
The purpose of the condition is to prevent the possibility of an infinite loop.
- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
They are evaluated once before the loop begins.
- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
The condition is also evaluated once before each loop iteration.
- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
The afterthought is evaluated at the end of the loop iteration.
- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
It is used to update/increment the counter variable initialized in the for loop.
