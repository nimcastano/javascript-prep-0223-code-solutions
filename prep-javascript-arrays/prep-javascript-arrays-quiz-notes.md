## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the principal use of arrays?
An array is principally used to hold multiple values. It can hold any kind of data type.
- Describe the syntax (structure) of array-literals in JavaScript.
Arrays are often declared with const. After the variable name and assignment operator, the values inside an array are held inside brackets, [].
- What number represents the **first** index of an array?
The first index of an array is 0.
- How can you access the last element of an array?
To access the last element, use the index
[array.length - 1]. This takes advantage of the length method and because the first index is zero, we need to subtract one.
